# TeaSet Package
This package is designed to create ternary plots and manipulate data in a ternary format.  It is built using R's basic graphics functions rather than grid, lattice or ggplot2.  In addition to standard ternary plots, this package also supports distorting and inverting the ternary plot, depending on what the user may want.
